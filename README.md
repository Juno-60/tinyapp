# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It's definitely not pretty, but it works*!

Some things to note: 
- All databases are stored in objects, which are cleared when the server resets. Sorry!
- You also have to manually type your shortened URL into the address bar, which makes the
  whole app kinda useless. Maybe I'll fix that once I actually understand HTML.
- Only the bare minimum of requirements are met, because I ran out of time! Whoops!
